Mellya Vargas
Year Up Student, Class 23
Application Development

I’m currently a junior developer learning computer networking systems at Seattle Central College through a program called Year Up. I’ve been strengthening these skills through my experience in the hospitality industry where I’ve worked in a team to develop a natural wine delivery platform. My extracurricular hobbies are related to my current job as a wine buyer, I love spending time in the Willamette Valley supporting my winemaker friends during  harvest season and I always look forward to a conscious conversation about winemaking, agricultural practices, and farm labor rights.  My goal is to complete Year Up in April 2023, receive my certifications, and become a Front-End Software Developer with a major tech company here in Seattle to explore the possibilities of finding remote work for the opportunity to live seasonally in Mexico to access more time with my family.
